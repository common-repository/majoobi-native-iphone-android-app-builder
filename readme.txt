= How easy is it to build my own app? Do I need any technical skills? =
Building your own app with Majoobi is as easy as it gets! Using your mouse and keyboard you can have your app up and running in a matter of minutes!

= Can I build more than one app? =
Yes. Once you've logged into your own account, you can build as many apps as you wish. Please remember, our pricing is per app.

= Which languages are supported? =
Any Left-to-right language is supported and can be used within your app.

= How do I distribute my app? =
Besides being listed in app stores, your app will have a short URL address that you can promote to your audience. If opened on a mobile device, the URL address will automatically open the installation page of your app from the app store; whereas if opened on a PC browser the URL will display a Live Preview of your app along with installation instructions. Once you've logged in to your account, you'll also be able to generate a QR code for your app and embedding code which you can place in your site. Otherwise, you may use Twitter, Facebook or any other method to promote your app.

= How much does it cost to have my own app? =
Subscription prices vary depending on the package of your choice, our pricing page can be found [here](http://www.majoobi.com/pricing/ "Majoobi Pricing Page").

= What is your cancellation policy? =
You can cancel your subscription anytime, there is a no minimum subscription period, you may cancel your subscription at any time by dropping us a message about it. Please note we don't provide refunds for past payment.

= How do I log in to my account? =
You may log in to your account by clicking on the **Log in** link located on the top of every page on [our website](http://www.majoobi.com/ "Majoobi Home Page").

= How do I update my app? =
Log in to your account, click on **My Apps**, then click on the **Edit** link corresponding to your app.

= How can I add a new app? =
You can do that by logging in to your account, click on **Account** link that appears on top of the page, then click on the **Add New App** button.

= Do I need to have an App Store and Android Market accounts to submit my app? =
Yes as we will need to publish your app under your own account. Once you've purchased your app, you'll see an **App Stores** settings tab in your account that allows you to enter your account credentials in order for us to submit and maintain your app in the future. Under the same tab, you'll also see detailed step-by-step instructions on how to open your App Store and Android Market accounts. It costs a $25 one-time fee to open an Android Market account whereas Apple charges $99/year for an App Store account.

= Will you submit my app on my behalf? =
Yes, we'll handle app submissions on your behalf as dealing with Apple can be somehow challenging.

= How long does it take for my app to appear in app stores? =
It usually takes 1 â€“ 2 weeks for an app to be approved in Apple's App Store. Android Market has no approval process, once we submit your app it will be published immediately.

= My app is ready for submission to app stores, how do I notify you? =
Simply click on the **Submit** button that is relevant to your app, fill in the required details (app name, icon, splash screen, description, keywords, etc.) and we'll take it from there.

= Once submitted, how can I follow up on my app status? =
Once you've clicked on the **Submit** button, you'll be able to see the status of your app for both App Store and Android Market from within your account.

= What is Push Notifications? =
Push notifications are messages that you can send to your customers to communicate important pieces of information. On iPhone and iPad devices, push messages are displayed on the device screen (similar to SMS messages) whereas on Android devices they appear on the top status bar as notifications.

= How long would it take for my Push Notifications to appear on devices? =
Whereas Apple makes no guarantees, Push Notifications on iPhone and iPad devices are mostly instant. For Android, we've written our own *pull service* to enable this feature and it takes about 10 minutes for a notification to come through.
